# I've been thinking
Over the last five years, I've been a student. First at Spokane Fall Community College and then Eastern Washington University. I've spent some time traveling around the US. I've studied abroad in Japan for a month. I've interned and proceeded to do freelance work for a local marketing firm. I've worked on campus for SFCC working on Annual School Publication The Wire Harp and at Eastern doing design work for the Theatre Department. I've won awards, and I've participated in one-day design competitions for charity, even winning one (with the help of some pretty amazing designers and friends). I've visited design firms in Seattle and Spokane. I've talked with some amazing people and found some incredible friends.

Although, during all this, I've been a student. Maybe, it's time to start looking at this differently. With my educational career coming to a close in the near future, it's time to start thinking design.
