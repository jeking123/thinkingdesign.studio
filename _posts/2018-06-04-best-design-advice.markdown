1. Be Empathetic
It's important to always empathize with the viewer or user of your design and try to understand what you're creating from their perspective. Gather insight from strangers, and people who may or may not know anything about your project.

2. Be consistent
make sure to check that you're being consistent in how you implement your design techniques.
