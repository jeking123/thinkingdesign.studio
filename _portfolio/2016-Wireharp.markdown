An annual creative lit & art publication by Spokane Falls Community College. During this project, I worked under a design professor to select, manage the assets and develop the book. I worked with the Art and Photography instructors to select from the art submissions. I digitally enhanced and cropped the photographs of the artwork. then after developing the design of the interior of the book. I selected paper stocks for the interior and exterior and chose to foil stamp the cover illustration.
