I was influenced to create this poster after I returned from summer 2017 studying abroad in Japan. One of my favorite memories in Japan was when a group of my friends and I took a day trip out to a local mountain. We spent the day hiking up the mountain, eating at some small shops at the top, and looking out into the deep forests outside of Tokyo, Japan. but the moment that I really enjoyed was getting to explore the mountain temple.

With this poster I wanted to capture the moment before you enter the temple grounds, and the climb up to the entrance. It was a powerful trip, and while the temple itself is beautiful, it was the journey, not the arrival that excited me.
