        <p class="has-text-left">Thinking Design Studio, as a company, is many things. It's who I am, but also what I do, and what I've done. I'm a student, and have been a student for many years, however, I'm also a local professional and artist. I'm Jeremy King, a local designer, student, and professional in the Spokane area. I'm a Front-End Developer and will soon graduate from Eastern Washington University with minors in Art and Japanese.</p>
        <p class="has-text-left">My plans for this site, will be to post my work, projects, art, travel, photography, and general info I come across. This will be my platform to communicate my skills, capabitlities, experiences and some of my interests. </p>
        <p class="has-text-left ">
          Please follow along with me if you would like to keep in touch and see what I've been working on.
